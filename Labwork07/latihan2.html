      <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
      <p>The <hl>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</hl>, <hl>Sebelas Maret University</hl>, 
      Surakarta is an <hl>Educational PersonnelEducation Institution (LPTK)</hl> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has 
      its own characteristics in producing <hl>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</hl>.</p>
      
      <p>The <hl>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</hl> study program is planned to take shelter in the management
      of the <hl>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</hl> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where
      the PTIK study program is under the direction of the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce
      graduates who are <hl>prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</hl>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under
      the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <hl>Building Engineering Education</hl>, and <hl>Mechanical
      Engineering Education</hl>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by
      the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <hl>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</hl>.</p>
